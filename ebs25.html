            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>This work group aims to advance the development and application of neuromorphic sensors, including dynamic vision sensors (DVS), SCAMP, neuromorphic radar, and olfactory sensors. By leveraging the inherent advantages of neuromorphic sensors such as low power consumption, low data rate, and high dynamic range, we seek to revolutionize multiple fields. Our goals include enhancing satellite imaging and situational awareness through neuromorphic cameras in space, advancing SCAMP cameras for high-speed, low-latency image processing in robotics and surveillance, and developing neuromorphic radar systems for superior object detection and environmental sensing. Additionally, we aim to innovate olfactory sensors for health diagnostics and environmental monitoring. Through fostering collaboration between academia and industry, providing hands-on experience, and organizing workshops and seminars, we intend to accelerate the commercialization of neuromorphic technologies and significantly contribute to the scientific community.</p>
